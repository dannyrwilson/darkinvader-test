## Setup

Git clone this repo
https://github.com/dannyrwilson/darkinvader-test


1. Once cloned/forked, run "composer install" within your project directory
2. Once this is complete, go ahead and create a database for the application
3. Once this has been done and the relevant database details within the .env file have been updated, the migration method can be called.
4. Run "php artisan migrate" this will generate the ticket and user table.

To run the scheduler manually, run:

"php artisan schedule:work"

This will generate a ticket once every minute and update the status to completed every 5 minutes.
